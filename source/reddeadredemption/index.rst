Former gang memeber **John Marston** has been kidnapped by **Edgar Ross** and **Archer Fordham**. They have also captured his family. These two guys work for  the U.S. government, and will only free Marston's family if he brings three of his former gang members to justice. The three gang members are **Bill Williamson**, **Javier Escuella**, and **Dutch van der Linde**.                                                                                         

Marston first seeks out Bill to rescue his family. Bill has been hiding in his fort, Fort Mercer, where Marston starts to persuade him to surrender. Bill wants nothing to do with Marston and starts to get rattled by his words. Marston ends up being shot and almost dies, but is saved by a nearby rancher. Once healthy, Marston starts doing quests around the area to create allies that will help him overthrow Fort Mercer.                                                        


Marston ends up taking over the fort, but has found out Bill has seeked refugee in Mexico with the other former gang member, Javier Escuella. Marston arrives in Mexico, but quickly became involved with the rebellion against the government. Marston becomes a double agent, assisting both sides of the civil war in hope to receive help finding the gang members. When the government finds out Marston has been helping the rebellion, Marston seeks help from **Abraham Reyes**, the rebellion leader. Marston and Reyes work together to overthrow the government, and find out the government has been protecting Javier and Bill the entire time. Marston kills Javier, then quickly raids the house of the government's leader, **Allende**. Marston and Reyes are successful in killing both Allende and Bill. Marston is now left with only Dutch to deal with.                                                                                                              

Marston returns to America in search for Dutch. With the help of Ross and Fordham, the three of them have found Dutch's hideout in the mountains. Dutch has begun a new gang consisting of Native Americans that hate the government just as much as Dutch. Marston and the U.S. government succesfully take over Dutch and his gang. Dutch commits suicide after he warns Marston that the government will betray him someday.                                                            


The game's campaign ends with John and his family building their new ranch with the help of Uncle. Once complete with the ranch, Ross appears with other agents and open fire on the family. Marston is able to save his son, Jack, and his wife, Abigail, but soon dies from the barrage of bullets. The game continues as **Jack Marston**, who seeks to revenge his father's death and kill Ross.

These side quests can range from helping wrangle a horse, becoming a bounty hunter, or hunting an animal. One aspect of the game allows the player to use a lasso as a tool. This tool can be used on humans which is useful when you must hogtie a bounty and turn it in. The lasso may also be used on animals, such as horses, so the player can ride the animal.
