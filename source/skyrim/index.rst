The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
===========================

*Skyrim* is a wonderful open world game fun for anyone and everyone. The enormous land of *Skyrim* will allow any player to be occupied for countless hours. The freedom *Skyrim* gives to the player is what makes this game one of the best RPG games to date. It does not require much skill to master this game, but knowledge about the minor details does help the player throughout the experience. 

Plot
----

The storyline starts with the player being help prisoner and being taken to their execution with fellow prisoners. (To learn more about how the player chooses their character, see :ref:`playable-chacracters-reference`.) A dragon disrupts the execution and continues to destroy the city. Throughout the mayhem, the player escapes to a nearby city named Whiterun. The player runs into another dragon, where we learn the character is a Dragonborn. This begins the quest to save the world from the first dragon, **Alduin**, who seeks to destroy it. Along the way, the player has endless side quests that affect their storyline. Ranging from theive guilds to dragons, werewolves and vampires, the player has a lot to look forward to.

The Land - Skyrim [#f1]_

During this time, there is a civil war between the **Stormcloaks** and the **Empire's Imperial Legion**. The region ranges from forests, mountains, snowy tundras, and farmland. There are five main cities, but multiple other minor cities.

Gameplay
--------

Compared to prior Elder Scrolls games, *Skyrim* is a different experience. *Bethesda* has leaned away from the typical class picking, such as warriors, wizards, rouges, etc. Instead, the game now allows you to work on whatever skill you would like to upgrade throughout the experience. Despite the opening scene, you are put straight into harms way within the first few minutes. The graphics may not look the best, but you have to give some slack to the creators due to the immense map and endless quests the world has to offer. 

The combat of *Skyrim* is an enjoyable experience, but challenging if the player wants it to be. Depending on the user's approach to fighting, the enemies may be a challenge. Archery is a fun aspect of the game. Archers must be precise with their aim when using ranged weapons since there is not aim assist. The thrill of striking an unexpected enemy from afar is comparable to scoring a touchdown in a big game. The player must be aware of their ammunition, once they are out of arrows, they must find, create, or buy more. Depending on the enemy, a more powerful arrow may be required to do damage. A starting arrow may not do nearly as much damage to a dragon compared to the daedric arrows. Users who depend on Magika need to be cautious of their amount available. Activating different shrines may allow the player to regenerate their Magika faster. Melee based players are in for a fun time as well. Whether they dual-wield, use a shield and one-handed weapon, or use a two-handed weapon, they fighter must be cautious of their enemy's ability within close range. A couple skeletons are easy to kill when close up, but a horde of bandits will do damage if the player is not well prepared.

Guilds & Factions
-----------------

There are different guilds and factions that a player may join. Once in a guild, the player is able to rank up and eventually become a master. Factions are similar, but the player may make the opposing faction an enemy depending on which faction they join.
